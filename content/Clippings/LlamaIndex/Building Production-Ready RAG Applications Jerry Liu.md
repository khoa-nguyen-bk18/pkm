Large Language Models (LLM's) are starting to revolutionize how users can search for, interact with, and generate new content. Some recent stacks and toolkits around Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) have emerged where users are building applications such as chatbots using LLMs on their own private data. This opens the door to a vast array of applications. However while setting up a naive RAG stack is easy, productionizing it is hard. In this talk, we talk about core techniques for evaluating and improving your retrieval systems for better performing RAG.
